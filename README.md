# Snap Connect Foster Youth Codebase

Hi, This is the Snap Connect codebase for team Foster Youth. The engineers working on this codebase is Jovanna de la Trinidad and David Sun. We hope Snap Connect encourages Foster Youth to really connect with themselves and the communities built for them.

## Introduction to Snap Connect

Snap Connect is a new feature project from the Team Foster Youth from Snap Academies. 
Jovanna de la Trinidad and David Sun are the Engineers
Felix Breitbach and Tatiahna Bentley are the Storytellers
Stephanie Cardoso and Anthony Hernandez are the Designers
Together we hope to empower foster youth to connect with themselves and others through Snap Connect

## 2. Running the program

The code's framework is React Native and coded in JSX format. You would need to have expo operating on your system. Install Expo Go on your phone if you wish to run it from there. After doing ' yarn expo start --tunnel' , you will get a qr code in the terminal and you will be able to scan that code through the Expo Go app on your phone.

## 3. Screenshots of Application

Here the feature lives in the Chat Screen of the Snap App.

When we enter by clicking the Snap Connect Icon, we are able to see the main page with the three main compoenents, Journals, Friend Suggestions and Community.

Let's head into the Journals Screen. Here we can see the variety of text, image and recording posts.

Lets try to make a post. Here you have the AI Chatbot on top. With text input as the default setting. There you have a selection of the additional formats you want to add to the post. Once you are done, you can submit it.

The communities page is similar to Journals Screen but now you are able to communicate with other Foster Youth on topics like Resources!
